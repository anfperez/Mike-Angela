      <p> Birthday: 05/20/1987 </p>
      <p> Affiliations: Jedi Temple, Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, UCSS Nostromo, Sternbild Hero Academy </p>
      <p> Favorite video game: Final Fantasy IX </p>
      <p> I was born in Queens, NY. My mom Aura sent me to live in Quezon City, Philippines, with my relatives for the first few years of my life. Then I returned to the US and attended elementary and high school in Roselle, NJ. I went to Fordham University in the Bronx. I joined a science-fiction/video game/anime club, and it was there that I met Mike and many of my lifelong friends. I met him in September 2005 at Club Fair Day! I didn't know how important this meeting would be until later. We were both dating different people so I never thought we would date each other. But things worked out, so we started dating in September 2007. </p>
      <p> Mike has really helped me through a lot of difficult things in my life, most especially during the death of my mom in 2013. He is probably the best male figure I have in my life, so I'm very grateful to him for taking such good care of me. Life is </p>
